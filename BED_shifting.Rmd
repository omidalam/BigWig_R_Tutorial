Import sample BED.
If your BED has more than 3 columns (check it with head file.bed in terminal) This won't work! Don't know why!
```{r}
bed<-import("./sample_file/H3K4me3_ENCFF148POZ_hg38.bed")
head(bed,10)
```
1- I will use subsetting to extract some of the beds.
2- shift them some number.
3- And replace it.
```{r}
number_to_shift=2e5 ##200kb


shifted_beds<-shift(bed[(seqnames(bed)=="chr1")&start(bed)>=779600&start(bed)<=1e6],number_to_shift)

bed[(seqnames(bed)=="chr1")&start(bed)>=779600&start(bed)<=1e6]<-shifted_beds
head(bed,10)
```

Note that idices>5 has been shifted 

```{r}
export(bed,"./sample_file/shifted.bed")
```
